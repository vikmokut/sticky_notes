# LINKED LIST

Similar to an array, a linked list is a DATA STRUCTURE;
a storage used for organizing and processing data.

LL is a dynamic (non-fixed memory size, can be randomly updated at runtime),
linear typed(arranged sequentially) DATA STRUCTURE.

**Each element in a linked list is a NODE or Structure(data).**

***Every Node/structure has two important properties:***
* Data item (of any given data type)
* Pointer - to the next node

***There are several types of linked lists based on their features:***
1. Singly linked list:
2. Doubly linked list:

==========practice, practice, practice==========
### DECLARING A LINKED LIST:

i) 	Declare a struct for your node: defining the data items to hold, and pointer.

ii)	Declare your nodes(as pointers) using your struct as data type.

iii)	Dynamically allocate memory, the size of your struct.

iv)	a) Assign values to each node &

b) Link current node to next node (This is the linked list concept)
