HOW TO WRITE EXECUTABLE SHELL COMMANDS

Description: This is a simple guide to writing executable shell commands that can be called by their exact name without specifying the absolute path.

Open your terminal;

1. Create a folder (preferably in the root directory) where you will keep all of your script files.

2. Create a file and open for editing using your preferred text editor.

3. Write your script command #!/bin/bash or #!/bin/sh depending on your shell.

4. Write the commands into your file to describe the operation to be performed by the script your are creating.

5. Save and quit your file.

6. Make your file executable using the chmod command.

7. Open the .bashrc file in your home (~/) directory with your preferred editor. This requires admin privileges.

8. Add you directory containing your executable files to path by typing in: PATH="absolute_dir_path:$PATH"

9. Exit terminal and reopen it.

Now any excutable scripts in this directory can be called from anywhere in your terminal.

-----example-----

Assumiing we create a folder called "ease" in our root directory and a file named "a" - that lists all files in long format including hidden files.

- open terminal
- cd /
- mkdir ease
- vi a

Content of a below:

#!/bin/bash
ls -l -a

- :wq
- chmod +x a
- cd
- sudo vi .bashrc
- PATH="/ease:$PATH"
- :wq
- Exit and reopen terminal

Now just like ls, pwd... you can simply type a and it lists all files and directories in the current working directory in long format including hidden files.
